## I'm Silas Wunder (he/him)!

- I hold a bachelor's degree in Data Science withg a concentration in Computer Science, and minors in both Statistics and Machine Learning.
- I'm passionate about leveraging data and technology to drive positive social impact, particularly interested in the intersection of data science and social justice advocacy.
- I currently work with DoorDash as a Data Analyst and don't have much time to devote to personal projects unfortunately.
- My GitHub showcases a mix of school projects and personal projects, with a focus on data analysis, machine learning, and software development.
- Check out my capstone project [LegiScan](https://github.com/silas-wunder/LegiScan) for the most comprehensive example of my work.
