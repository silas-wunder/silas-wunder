## Howdy!

# I am Silas Wunder (he/him)!

- I am currently a student at Colorado State University pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science with a concentration in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.
- I am especially interested in Machine Learning and its applications to the world of social advocacy, specifically in the legal domain.
- My GitHub houses a couple school projects and personal projects, though these do not do a great job of representing my knowledge (I'm working on changing that with more projects ðŸ˜ƒ)
- If you need to contact me for any reason, my primary email is spwunder12@gmail.com
